Summary: If a player attempts to purchase a card from the supply which has been embargoed, they will not receive any curses.

Description: Having set the number of embargo tokens on copper to 1 and the number of buy actions of the current player to 1 and ensuring that the player is in the buy phase, one executes buyCard with the first argument being copper and the second value being a pointer to the game state. Instead of the player’s discard gaining a new curse card, nothing happens, which means that the embargo card simply does nothing.
