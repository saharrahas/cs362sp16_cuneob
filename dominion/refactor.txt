Re-factor Summary:

The card effect code for each of the following cards has been moved out of
the function cardEffect() and into their own, compartmentalized functions:

    - adventurer
    - council_room
    - feast
    - gardens
    - mine
    - remodel
    - smithy
    - village
    - baron
    - great_hall
    - minion
    - steward

each of these functions have a name conforming to the following format:

    <cardName>_effect(...)



Notes/Details:


- Included, though commented out, are some empty functions corresponding to each
  of the rest of the card effects that have not yet been factored out of the
  function cardEffect().

- All pre-existing variables that were originally used in each case body in
  cardEffect() are now passed in to their corresponding function

- All function parameter names used in the refactored card effects are consistent
  with the original variables used by the function cardEffect(), in order to avoid
  any confusion.

- The temporary variables used in each case body have been recreated in each function
  as needed and using the same names. All temporary variables that are no longer used
  by any case bodies in cardEffect() as a result of the refactoring have been subsequently
  removed.
